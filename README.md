# Deciduous üå≥

A simple [Firefox Add-On](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions) that helps me capture notes in the browser, before copying them to my clipboard.

### Intention / Motivation

When I'm browsing the web, I often find useful nuggets, or I learn some interesting concepts that I'd like to save for reference. Unfortunately, to get these thoughts from browser to my note-taking app, it requires a context switch. This switch can be expensive (depending on my screen's layout at the time); and this is especially so if I'm in the middle of something that requires a good deal of focus.

This small problem is the origin of Deciduous. It's a no-frills extension that takes a small note (a leaf üçÉ) and appends it to a document in the browser's localstorage (the tree üå≥). At the end of a browsing session, it's easy to hit the "copy" button, which copies the text of the entire tree to the clipboard, ready for pasting into my note-taking app in one fell swoop.

For now, I have no intention of listing this extension on the Firefox marketplace, nor do I intend on supporting this on Chrome, but those are certainly things I could consider in the future, if this becomes very useful.
